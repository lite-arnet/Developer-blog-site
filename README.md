# Project Description

This project is a blog site built using Angular 14, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and CSS for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. The site features categories, featured blogs, dynamic view counts, published dates, and similar blog posts of the same categories.

The publishing of posts is handled by an admin dashboard, which is separate from the main site. In the admin dashboard, new blog categories can be created, existing categories can be edited or deleted, and subscribers can be managed.

Users can subscribe to the blog to receive updates on new posts.

This project provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for sharing and discovering new content.
